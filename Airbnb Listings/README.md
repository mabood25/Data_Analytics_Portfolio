**Objective**: To analyze, create segments and predict listing probability, based on Airbnb listings in order to optimize performance and inform strategic decision-making regarding property management and marketing initiatives.

**Context**: Australia was one of the most restrictive countries in terms of the pandemic, closing its borders and restricting the movement of people from March 2020 for approximately 18 months, only allowing tourism to resume in 2022. This situation clearly affected businesses like Airbnb, which suddenly lost all their demand both immediately and in the future. For the upcoming years, Melbourne is the most populous city in Australia and one of the largest in the world. It has features that make it a desirable tourist destination, such as its Victorian architecture, its oceanfront location, a central business district (CBD), a significant port, and being one of the cities with an international events agenda.

Scope: We aim to assist Airbnb hosts in optimizing their property management and marketing strategies by analyzing sales data and providing actionable insights. The scope includes analyzing booking trends, identifying peak booking periods, and recommending strategies to maximize occupancy rates and revenue.
